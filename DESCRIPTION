Description: 
    This package contains several functions that speed up routine processes at
    Grifols R&D. At this moment, it contains four functions: two of them focused
    on summarizing the results of a Mixed Model of Repeated Measures (sigTables
    and mmrmTables), one is dedicated to calculating baseline levels for each 
    biomarker (basals.R) and one of them to plot the results of a mixed model as
    a Volcano Plot (statistical significance vs magnitude of change). This 
    package will be updated in the future with the addition of new functions.
