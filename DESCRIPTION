Description: 
    This package contains several functions that speed up routine processes at
    Grifols R&D. At this moment, it contains three functions: two of them focused
    on summarizing the results of a Mixed Model of Repeated Measures (sigTables
    and mmrmTables) and the other is dedicated to calculating baseline levels
    for each biomarker (basals.R). This package will grow in the future with the
    addition of new functions.
