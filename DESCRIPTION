Description: 
    This package contains several functions that speed up routine processes at
    Grifols R&D. At this moment, it contains nine functions: four of them focused
    on summarizing the results of a Mixed Model of Repeated Measures (sigTables,
    metTables, mmrmTables, metBarPlot); one is dedicated to calculating baseline
    levels for each biomarker (basals.R); two of them to plot the results of a 
    mixed model as a Volcano Plot (statistical significance vs magnitude of 
    change) and as a Venn Diagram (to compare unique and shared biomarkers 
    between two top-tables); a function designed to find and plot outliers in a 
    given dataframe; and a function that creates a correlation map from a 
    provided dataframe.
