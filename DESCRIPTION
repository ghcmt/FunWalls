Description: 
    This package contains several functions that speed up routine processes at
    Grifols R&D. At this moment, it contains six functions: two of them focused
    on summarizing the results of a Mixed Model of Repeated Measures (sigTables
    and mmrmTables); one is dedicated to calculating baseline levels for each 
    biomarker (basals.R); two of them to plot the results of a mixed model as
    a Volcano Plot (statistical significance vs magnitude of change) and as a Venn
    Diagram (to compare unique and shared biomarkers between two top-tables);
    and a function that creates a correlation map from a given dataframe. 
    This package will be updated in the future with the addition of new functions.
