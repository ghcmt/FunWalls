Useful Functions for Daily Work at Grifols

This package contains several functions that speed up routine processes at Grifols R&D. At this moment, it contains four functions: two of them focused on summarizing the results of a Mixed Model of Repeated Measures (sigTables and mmrmTables), one is dedicated to calculating baseline levels for each biomarker (basals.R) and one of them to plot the results of a mixed model as a Volcano Plot (statistical significance vs magnitude of change). This package will be updated in the future with the addition of new functions.
