Useful Functions for Daily Work at Grifols
This package contains several functions that speed up routine analysis at Grifols R&D. At this moment, it contains three functions: two of them focused on summarizing the results of a Mixed Model of Repeated Measures (sigTables and mmrmTables) and the other is dedicated to calculating baseline levels for each biomarker (basals). This package will grow in the future with the addition of new functions.
