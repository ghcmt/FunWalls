Useful Functions for Daily Work at Grifols

This package contains several functions that speed up routine processes at Grifols R&D. At this moment, it contains eight functions: three of them focused on summarizing the results of a Mixed Model of Repeated Measures (sigTables, metTables and mmrmTables); one is dedicated to calculating baseline levels for each biomarker (basals.R); two of them to plot the results of a mixed model as a Volcano Plot (statistical significance vs magnitude of change) and as a Venn Diagram (to compare unique and shared biomarkers between two top-tables); a function designed to find and plot outliers in a given dataframe; and a function that creates a correlation map from a provided dataframe.
